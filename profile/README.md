Imposters-KRMU is a group of enthusiastic B.Tech Computer Science students from K.R. Mangalam University. This organization serves as a platform for the four of us to collaborate, share resources, and archive the hackathon projects and other technical projects we have participated in or made. We are dedicated to learning, innovation, and leveraging our skills to create meaningful projects.

## About Us

Imposters-KRMU consists of four passionate B.Tech Computer Science students who are committed to pushing the boundaries of their technical skills and knowledge. Despite our small size, we have a strong drive to explore new technologies, engage in problem-solving, and foster an environment of continuous learning. Our diverse backgrounds and perspectives allow us to bring unique ideas to the table and support each other's growth.

## Objectives

- *Collaboration and Resource Sharing*: As a tight-knit group, we emphasize collaboration and support. We actively share resources, knowledge, and insights related to computer science, helping each other to enhance our skills and broaden our understanding of various technologies.

- *Archiving Projects*: We use Imposters-KRMU as a platform to archive our hackathon projects and other technical endeavors. This ensures that our projects are documented, easily accessible, and can serve as references for future initiatives or portfolios.

## How to Contribute

As a small organization, our primary focus is internal collaboration among the four of us. However, we appreciate and welcome any feedback or suggestions from the wider community. If you are interested in our work or have any questions, feel free to reach out to us via [admin@projectrexa.ml](mailto:admin@projectrexa.ml).
